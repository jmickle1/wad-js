## Uploader

Use the WAD Uploader to add files you want to inspect with wadJS. Supported file formats are `.wad`, `.zip`, and `.pk3`.

You can upload multiple files from your device.

Alternatively, you can upload one file at a time from the Internet by entering a URL and also specify the name of the file. It is recommended to add the file extension to the file name (e.g., "doom1.wad") for clarity.

Zipped files must contain only one WAD file to be processed. The handling of compressed files containing more than one WAD file or nested zipped files will be added at a later date.

You can upload a file with the same name multiple times. This allows you to compare different versions of a WAD.

## Uploaded WADs

This list of uploaded WADs allows you to browse between the different WADs you have added to wadJS.

## WAD Metadata

On this panel, you can see some data about the WAD in general.

You can also change the filename to your convenience, but it can not be empty.

## Lump Types

You can select the type of lumps you wish to view within a selected WAD.

## WAD Lumps

This part of the application shows details about the lumps that belong to a specific type.
