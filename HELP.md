## Uploader

Use the WAD Uploader to add files you want to inspect with wadJS. Supported file formats are `.wad`, `.zip`, and `.pk3`.

You can upload multiple files from your device.

Alternatively, you can upload one file at a time from the Internet by entering a URL and also specify the name of the file. It is recommended to add the file extension to the file name (e.g., "doom1.wad") for clarity.

Zipped files must contain only one WAD file to be processed. The handling of compressed files containing more than one WAD file or nested zipped files will be added at a later date.

You can upload a file with the same name multiple times. This allows you to compare different versions of a WAD.

Additionally, all the files you upload to wadJS are kept in the memory of your device's browser. This means that you can leave the application or refresh the page without having to reuploaded all your files afterwards.

Please note that it is usually necessary to use an IWAD as a reference when loading a PWAD, especially if the PWAD does not have data concerning the play palettes. If you do not link your PWADs to an IWAD, you might not be able to preview certain resources such as sprites, textures, patches, etc. If you link a PWAD to the incorrect IWAD, the colors of its graphic assets might be weird depending on the play palettes of the IWAD. To remedy to this issue, make sure that you upload the necessary IWAD first, and then select this IWAD when uploading PWADs.

## Uploaded WADs

This list of uploaded WADs allows you to browse between the different WADs you have added to wadJS.

The WADs of the same type (IWADs a.k.a Internal WADs and PWADs a.k.a Patch WADs) are displayed in their own group. This allows for more clarity on your list of uploaded WADs.

Click on the trash icon next to the name of a WAD to remove it from the list. The trash icon above the list will remove all WADs from the application memory.

## WAD Metadata

On this panel, you can see some data about the WAD in general.

You can also change the filename to your convenience, but it can not be empty.

## Lump Types

You can select the type of lumps you wish to view within a selected WAD.

## WAD Lumps

This part of the application shows details about the lumps that belong to a specific type.
