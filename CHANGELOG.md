## v0.1.11: Group map lumps together

* With this new update, lumps such as "THINGS", "VERTEXES" (sic! the plural of vertex is vertices...), "LINEDEFS", etc., are now grouped under the lump that holds the name of the map. As a result, the lumps in question do not show up in the list anymore but they will soon once I focus more on the map lumps.
