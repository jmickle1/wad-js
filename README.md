# Web Tool <https://jmickle66666666.github.io/wad-js/>

### Front-end tool for editing wads on the web.

Load a wad from your device, or by URL and view many different types of lumps.

Preview support includes:

-   Text files
-   Audio files
-   Midi files
-   Graphics (Doom Image Format, Flats, PNGs)
-   ENDOOM, PLAYPAL and COLORMAP files
-   THINGS (displays thing count of Doom and Doom 2 types)

# WAD.js

### Javascript Library for manipulating Doom WAD format files

Read Doom WADs and access data from many different common lump types easily.

Current features include:

-   Loading WADs from local directories or URLs
-   Finding lumps in a WAD by name or index
-   Retrieving lump data as either text or binary data
-   Lump type detection (Common Text Data types, Mapdata, Graphics, Sprites, Flats, MIDI, MUS, and many more)
-   ENDOOM renderer (requires dos.png, a character map for the ASCII characters used)
-   PLAYPAL, COLORMAP renderer
-   Export Graphics and Flats to Canvas
-   Render Maps to Canvas

## Development

Simply clone this repository and run:

```
$ npm install
```

Depending on what you want to build, there are different ways to build it.

The base library, for use with Node.js, is built using:

```
$ npm run build
```

If you want to build a browser-friendly UMD library or a modern module-friendly
library, run this:

```
$ npm run build-dist
```

If you want to build the test application, run this:

```
$ npm run build-ui
```

If you would like to run the test application locally, download [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), extract the Caddy executable to the root of your working copy, and run it. The test app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Why?

Libraries for reading and manipulating doom wads exist in many languages, but not Javascript (until now). Exposing this access to the web can make for a much wider variety of interesting possibilities. Please make a cool web tool with this!

## How?

### Load WAD file from desktop

In your HTML, any standard file input such as:
`<input type="file" id="fileInput"/>`

And create a WAD object, and load the file like this:

```
var wad = new Wad(); // Create a new WAD object to load our file into

// Create a callback function when loading is complete
wad.onLoad = function() {
  alert('Wad successfully loaded!');
};

var fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
fileInput.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
  var file = fileInput.files[0];
  wad.load(file); // Load the file into the WAD object we created
}
```

### Load WAD file from URL

Create a WAD object and load the URL

```
var wad = new Wad(); // Create a new WAD object to load our file into

// Create a callback function when loading is complete
wad.onLoad = function() {
  alert('Wad successfully loaded!');
};

wad.loadURL('http://www.example.com/file.wad');
```

### Lumps

A directory of lump information is stored in `wad.lumps`, storing the names and also used internally to access the data of the lumps.

```
for (var i = 0; i < wad.lumps.length; i++) {
  console.log(wad.lumps[i].name); // Print the name of every lump in the WAD file.
}
```

These lump objects store `name`, `size` and `pos` (byte position in the WAD file). However, only the name will be useful for most cases.

To get the actual data for a lump, use the commands:
`wad.getLump(index)`
Return the lump data by index of the lump.
`wad.getLumpByName(name)`
Return the data of the first lump in the wad that matches `name`.

To ease finding lumps, there are some helper functions:
`wad.lumpExists(name)`
Returns true if a lump in the wad exists with the given `name`.
`wad.getLumpIndexByName(name)`
Just returns the index of the first lump matching the given name, instead of the entire data of the lump.
`wad.getLumpAsText(index)`
Return the lump data as a string instead of byte data.

## Lump interfaces

### Graphics

Doom uses a custom image format for most of the graphics in the game. These can be automatically converted to standard images by wad.js.

Example:

```
const graphic = new Graphic(); // We create Graphic objects just like Wad object files
graphic.load(wad.getLumpByName('PLAYA1'); // Load the player sprite from DOOM2.WAD
canvas = graphic.toCanvas(); // Export the image to a HTML5 canvas
document.body.appendChild(canvas); // Place the image on the page
```

### Flats

Flats are another image format used in Doom games, for sector floors and ceilings. The API matches the graphic format API.

`const flat = new Flat();`
Create a new Flat object
`flat.load(data);`
Load lump data into flat object
`flat.toCanvas();`
Return new canvas object with the flat's data rendered to it

### Playpal

The PLAYPAL lump is the palette used in the Doom wad, present in the IWAD files. If no PLAYPAL is present, a copy of the DOOM/2.WAD palette is used internally for graphics rendering.

`const playpal = new Playpal();`
Create a new Playpal object
`playpal.load(data);`
Load lump data into playpal object
`playpal.toCanvas();`
Render playpal to a canvas object and return it

### Colormap

The COLORMAP lump is used in Doom for lighting effects. It is an indexed list for each color in the palette with a ramp to darkness.

`const colormap = new Colormap();`
Create a new Colormap object
`colormap.load(data);`
Load lump data into colormap object
`colormap.toCanvas();`
Render the colormap to a canvas object and return it
