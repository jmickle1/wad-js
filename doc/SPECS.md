# Specs

## General goal

The aim of this app is to allow users to view and edit the content of Doom WAD files regardless of their Operating System.

## Why is it important?

Because many tools that are useful to the members of the Doom community only run on Windows or could use a better user experience.

## How will wadJS achieve this goal?

The app will be written purely in JavaScript and fully contained in the user's client. No back end will be necessary to store user data.


The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages servers for free. The integration with GitHub will allow faster development cycles. New versions of the app will be made available within seconds after compilation.
